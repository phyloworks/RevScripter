# RevScripter

## Description

RevScripter is a web-based graphical tool for creating scripts in the Rev language, which then can be executed in [RevBayes](https://revbayes.github.io). 

To use RevScripter on the web, go to:
[https://revbayes.github.io/revscripter/](https://revbayes.github.io/revscripter/)

Currently, the options available in RevScripter are limited and the tool is still very much in development. The tool can create scripts for running an unrooted analysis using nuceotide data under standard substitution models.

## Developers

The development of RevScripter is led by [Lorenzo Chavarria](https://github.com/LorenzoCh11), with contributions from Walker Pett, Tracy Heath, and Sebastian HÃ¶hna.

## Design

The design of RevScripter is very much inspired by the BEAUti tool in the BEAST[1,2] package and the graphical user interface for the program BPP[3].
